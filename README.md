#🌟 NLP Model Repository

Welcome to the NLP Model Repository — a clean, modular, and production-ready setup designed to make NLP development simple, powerful, and enjoyable. This project helps you quickly build, train, evaluate, and deploy state-of-the-art NLP models with ease.

#🚀 Overview

This repository brings together everything needed for a complete NLP workflow. From preprocessing raw text to training transformer models and deploying them as APIs — everything is neatly organized and easy to customize.

#✨ Key Features

🔤 Text preprocessing & cleaning

🧠 Support for BERT, DistilBERT, LSTM, GRU, and custom transformers

⚙️ Config-based experiment setup for full reproducibility

📊 Evaluation utilities to measure real performance

🗂️ Modular, easy-to-understand code design

🚀 Simple deployment using FastAPI

📝 Beginner friendly, production ready

🏁 Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and customize the configuration files as needed. You can plug in your own dataset and immediately begin running training and evaluation pipelines without modifying the core logic.

#🤖 Model Support

This repository supports a wide range of NLP model architectures, including:

#⭐ BERT

⭐ DistilBERT

⭐ LSTM & BiLSTM

⭐ GRU-based networks

⭐ Custom transformer models

All models use the same unified training structure for consistency and easy experimentation.

#🌐 Deployment

A ready-to-use FastAPI script is provided so you can instantly turn your trained model into an API endpoint for real-time predictions or full application integration.

#🤝 Contributing
